                            nestled on the banks of the Beas River in the mountains of 
                            the Himalayas. It is one of the premier places in the world 
                            to backpack as well as honeymoon. It offers skiing and trekking

                        <h2>About Manali</h2>
                        <p class="mb-5"> Manali is located at an approximate height of 8000 ft 
                            above the sea level. It is one of the best place to spend 
                            summer vacation. It is a prominent honeymoon destination as 
                            well. Activities like Trekking in Parvati Valley, skiing in 
                            the Solang Valley are popular there. Also, sports like Paragliding, 
                            Rafting and Mountaineering in the Pir Panjal Mountain there are one 
                            the major attractions of that resort town. One of the major tourist 
                            attraction in Manali is the Rohtang Pass which is located at the 
                            height of about 13000 ft above the sea level.</p>

                            <h2>History</h2>
                            <p class="mb-5">
                                Manali is named after the Sanatan Hindu lawgiver Manu. The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of 'Manu-Alaya' which literally means 'the abode of Manu'. Legend has it that sage Manu stepped off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world. Manali lies in the North of Kullu Valley. The valley is often referred to as the 'Valley of the Gods'. Old Manali village has an ancient temple dedicated to sage Manu.

The British introduced apple trees in the area. The first apple orchard was set up by the British near Patlikuhal, before this, no Apple trees grew in the area. To this day, apple— along with plum and pear— remain the best source of income for the majority of inhabitants. Both Rainbow and Brown Trout was also introduced into the rivers and streams of the area by the colonisers.

With the increase in disposable incomes and somewhat owing to the rise of disturbances in Kashmir in the late 1980s, Manali witnessed a surge in tourist traffic. This once quiet village was transformed into a bustling town with numerous homestays as well as the occasional boutique hotel. During the warmer summer months, cafes and restaurants can be seen doing brisk business.

                            <h2>Our Customers Say</h2>
                            <p> "There are many memorable moments in every man’s life. However, a few of them get indelibly etched in our memories. One of my most memorable moments is associated with a wonderful holiday at Manali. Travelling breaks the monotony of our routine. Thank God, there are so many beautiful places visiting which, we forget all the stresses and cares of our life! I got an opportunity to travel to one such place of extreme natural beauty, where peace and the pristine pastoral charm has not been affected by the modern industrial competition. During the summer vacation, I got the chance to visit Manali and the adjoining spots.



                                The best part was the journey to Manali. We set out early in the morning. The heat of the season began dwindling as our car went up the serpentine roads in the Himalayas. The drive from Sundar Nagar to Manali was a real treat to the eyes. On either side of the serpentine road breathtaking vistas of unmatched sylvan beauty soothed not only the eyes, but the restive soul also. Deep dells, with pure verdant slopes; idyllic, pastoral human settlements, glimpses of the far off white sheep grazing on the slopes of the mountains under the canopy of azure sky are the enthralling views one gets as a gift for coming to this paradise. I did not want the drive to end. As we neared Manali, the mountains became taller and taller. The peace, tranquility, and spledour of Manali and its surroundings were supernal."</p>

                            <p>"That was an auspicious day - my trip to Manali in Himachal Pradesh. I am a person who loves to travel long distances but while travelling to Manali I fell asleep. My mom woke me up to say we had reached. The moment I opened my eyes I was amazed - blue skies, white mountains, green land. It was very cold too. We stayed in a lodge near the river Beas. From the window of my room I was able to see the Rohtang pass. It was fully covered with snow. I haven't seen such a beautiful mountain ever before.


The very next day I was there playing in the snow. The guide said we won't be allowed on the pass during winter because the roads to Rohtang would be fully covered with snow. I was wondering how cold it would be in winter. For the first time I did some skiing and played a lot with the snow. My sister did paragliding, etc."</p>

                            <p> "This summer vacation my parents planned to visit Manali. We were very excited to go there. I and my sister started to pack our bags and started to imagine the level of excitement we'll have. We went there by train. The journey on the train was also very exciting. We saw many places through the window and the many things in the train. After reaching we found that the weather of Manali was very cool and soothing. We went to the temples and explored many places. The hotel room was also very beautiful. We stayed there for two days but was the most memorable trip of ours. Also, my mother bought a yak shawl from there. The shawl is very famous and is exclusively found there. We returned back via train. The trip was very exciting and we enjoyed a lot."</p>
